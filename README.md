# Front-End

## Instructions - PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU START WORKING.

- Clone this repository. There is no need to fork.
- cd into the `how-to-app` directory
- Create your own branch and work off of that branch
- Run `yarn install` to download dependencies.
- Still inside the `how-to-app` directory run `yarn start` to run the react application.

## Best Practices
- Try not to work on the same file at the same time someone else is doing so to prevent merge conflicts. Merge conflicts are not fun.
- If you must work on the same file at the same time, please utilize Live Share. Live Share can be doenloaded through the Extensions tab in VS Code. For more information on Liver Share, please visit: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack`.
- **DO NOT** merge your own code.
- Whenever any pull request is merged with master, everyone should pull at the same time to their local local directories to prevent any future merge conflicts.

## How?
	

## Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
